# Billing Information Capture - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Orders Tab to Admin Dashboard

**File Modified**: `components/alpha-console/AdminSidebar.tsx`

- Added "Orders" navigation item (positioned after Dashboard)
- Icon already existed in the codebase
- Orders page already exists at `/alpha-console/orders`

### 2. Database Schema Updates

**New Migration File**: `supabase-add-billing-info.sql`

Added billing fields to `orders` table:
- `billing_name` - Customer's full name from billing
- `billing_address_line1` - Street address
- `billing_address_line2` - Apt/Suite number
- `billing_city` - City
- `billing_state` - State/Province
- `billing_postal_code` - ZIP/Postal code
- `billing_country` - Country

Added billing fields to `applications` table:
- `billing_name` - For standalone service orders
- `billing_address` - JSONB field with complete address

**Updated**: `supabase-complete-setup.sql` with billing fields for new deployments

### 3. Order Creation Logic Updates

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/orders/confirm/route.ts` - Client-side order confirmation
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Webhook handler

**What Changed**:
Both files now extract billing details from Stripe's payment intent:

```typescript
// Extract billing details from Stripe charge
const chargeData = (paymentIntent.charges as any)?.data?.[0];
const billingDetails = chargeData?.billing_details;

const billingName = billingDetails?.name;
const billingAddress = billingDetails?.address;

// Save to order
const orderData = {
  ...
  billing_name: billingName,
  billing_address_line1: billingAddress?.line1,
  billing_address_line2: billingAddress?.line2,
  billing_city: billingAddress?.city,
  billing_state: billingAddress?.state,
  billing_postal_code: billingAddress?.postal_code,
  billing_country: billingAddress?.country,
  ...
};
```

**For Standalone Services**:
Application records now include billing info:

```typescript
const serviceApplication = {
  ...
  contact_first_name: billingName?.split(' ')[0],
  contact_last_name: billingName?.split(' ').slice(1).join(' '),
  billing_name: billingName,
  billing_address: {
    line1: billingAddress.line1,
    line2: billingAddress.line2,
    city: billingAddress.city,
    state: billingAddress.state,
    postal_code: billingAddress.postal_code,
    country: billingAddress.country
  },
  ...
};
```

## How It Works

### Checkout Flow (Already Implemented)

1. User fills out billing address in Stripe's `AddressElement` component (already in checkout form)
2. Stripe captures and validates the address
3. Address is attached to the payment intent automatically by Stripe
4. On success, Stripe redirects to success page

### Order Confirmation (Updated)

1. Success page calls `/api/orders/confirm` with payment_intent_id
2. API retrieves payment intent from Stripe
3. Extracts billing details from `payment_intent.charges.data[0].billing_details`
4. Saves order with complete billing information
5. For standalone services, creates application records with billing info

### Data Structure

**Billing Details from Stripe**:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "address": {
    "line1": "123 Main St",
    "line2": "Apt 4B",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postal_code": "10001",
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

**Stored in Orders Table**:
- Separate columns for each billing field
- Easy to query and filter

**Stored in Applications Table (for standalone services)**:
- `billing_name` as separate field
- `billing_address` as JSONB for flexible querying

## Migration Required

**Run this SQL in Supabase**:
```sql
-- Execute: supabase-add-billing-info.sql
```

This adds billing fields to existing tables without data loss.

## Benefits

### ✅ Complete Customer Information
- Name, email, and full address captured for every order
- No anonymous orders
- Easy customer lookup

### ✅ Standalone Service Orders Tracked
- Each service creates application with full billing info
- Contact information available for followup
- Can reference customer by name

### ✅ Admin Dashboard Visibility
- Orders tab accessible from sidebar
- View all orders with billing information
- Filter and search by customer details

### ✅ Better Order Management
- Ship physical items to billing address
- Contact customers about their orders
- Generate invoices with complete info

## What's Displayed in Dashboard

### Orders Page (`/alpha-console/orders`)
Shows:
- Order ID
- Customer Name (from billing)
- Customer Email
- Billing Country
- Total Amount
- Payment Status
- Date

### Application Details
For standalone services, shows:
- Contact Name (from billing)
- Email
- Full Address (from billing_address JSONB)
- Service Purchased
- Payment Status

## Testing

### Test Order with Billing Info

1. Add service to cart (or create application)
2. Go to checkout
3. Fill out billing address form:
   - Name: "John Doe"
   - Email: "john@test.com"
   - Address: "123 Test St"
   - City: "Test City"
   - State: "CA"
   - ZIP: "90210"
   - Country: "United States"
4. Complete payment with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Check admin dashboard → Orders
6. Order should show customer name and billing details

### Verify in Database

```sql
-- Check order billing info
SELECT
    order_id,
    billing_name,
    billing_address_line1,
    billing_city,
    billing_country,
    customer_email
FROM orders
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check standalone service application billing info
SELECT
    id,
    jurisdiction_name,
    billing_name,
    billing_address,
    contact_email
FROM applications
WHERE company_proposed_name LIKE 'Standalone Service:%'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Summary

✅ Orders tab added to dashboard sidebar
✅ Billing information captured from Stripe automatically
✅ Stored in database for all orders and standalone service applications
✅ Customer name and address available for reference
✅ No code changes needed in checkout form (already captures address)
✅ Works for both company formation and standalone service orders

**Next Steps**:
1. Run migration: `supabase-add-billing-info.sql`
2. Test with a real payment
3. Verify billing info appears in dashboard
